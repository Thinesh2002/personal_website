                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    I began my professional journey on February 15, 2023, when I joined
                    Digitweb Lanka as an E-commerce Executive. At that time, my
                    understanding of e-commerce systems was limited, and the learning
                    curve was steep. The early days were filled with real-world challenges
                    that shaped my practical knowledge and resilience.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    During this phase, I was guided by my team leader, Sathessvaran, one of
                    the most influential mentors in my career. His mentorship helped me
                    build a strong foundation in e-commerce operations and develop
                    confidence. With continuous learning and hands-on experience, I
                    progressed to managing Amazon Seller Central accounts independently,
                    contributing to account growth and operational stability.

                    As my expertise expanded, I was promoted to UK Market Lead, where I
                    handled performance monitoring, account health, and strategic planning
                    for the UK region.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    This period marked a turning point in my career, as I began exploring
                    the development side of e-commerce systems. Alongside my operational
                    responsibilities, I learned web development and eventually reached a
                    level where I could build, manage, and hand over complete projects
                    independently.

                    Following internal restructuring at Digitweb Lanka, I was promoted to
                    eBay Department Head. In this role, I manage eBay operations across
                    Europe and the US markets, overseeing seller accounts, team
                    performance, strategic planning, and marketplace growth. This position
                    significantly strengthened my leadership, decision-making, and

                    During my time at Digitweb Lanka, I had the opportunity to learn and apply

                    development experience, including designing and handling APIs, building
                    complete web applications, and solving real business problems through

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I also gained hands-on experience with VPS server hosting, application
                    deployment, and system configuration. In addition, I learned how to gather
                    system requirements, plan technical solutions, and perform testing to
                    ensure application stability, performance, and scalability.
